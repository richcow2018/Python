Line 12 is the problem. It is logic error. When user enters a smaller number, he will get a statement "Your guess is too low". Then following the next condition in line 11 his guess is not equal to number, the else condition will show the answer. 

We should display the final answer outside the while loop. Therefore, when user finish 6 times trial, he will get the answer at the end. 

Also prevent the input the wrong value, I will put try and except. Below is my fine tuned code.

import random
guess = 0
guesses_made = 0
name = raw_input("what is your name?\n")
number = random.randint(1,20)
print "Well,", name, ",I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20"
while guesses_made < 6:
    try:
        guess = int(raw_input("please enter a number"))
    except ValueError:
        print "Your must input integer only"
        
    guesses_made += 1
    if guess < number and guess != 0:
        print "Your guess is too low"
    if guess > number and guess != 0:
        print "Your guess is too high"
    if guess == number:
        print "good job,", name, "! you guessed my number in", guesses_made, "guesses!"
        break

print "Nope. The number I was thinking of was", number
